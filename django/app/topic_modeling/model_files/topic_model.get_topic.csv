The method is used in fast dynamic MR imaging. Prior to the formation of the fast dynamic image a normal magnetic resonance image with the full set of phase encoding steps is acquired for each sensor or coil. Then a subset of phase encoding trajectories is extracted commensurate with the phase encoding trajectories obtained by the fast dynamic imaging and an image is reconstructed from the above mentioned subset. Subsequently, the signals of the fast dynamic image are compared with the signals of the reconstructed image, thus yielding an estimate of the fold-over artefacts of the fast dynamic image. The signals of the fold-over artefacts thus compensate the signals obtained by the fast dynamic imaging and deliver a corrected image without artefact parts.

The\nballast circuit includes circuitry for generating DC in an AC-to-DC converter, capturing\nany AC ripple of the DC with a buffer capacitor to generate a control signal, generating\na high frequency lamp power signal from DC utilizing an HF inverter circuit and\nmodulating the high frequency power signal utilizing the control signal to generate\na frequency swept lamp power signal to drive the lamp while avoiding acoustic\nresonance.', 'An electronic ballast is provided which is capable of compactly powering a discharge lamp\nfrom a source of rectified, but unregulated, power having a varying DC voltage.

The resonant tank converts the pulses to a sinusoidal current for powering\nthe discharge lamp and includes an inductive impedance in series with the lamp\nfor providing a voltage drop which varies with the operating frequency. A feed-forward\ncontrol circuit is coupled to the converter for varying the operating frequency\ndirectly with variations in the DC source voltage. The voltage drop across the\ninductive impedance is substantially proportional to the magnitude of the DC\nsource voltage. This enables regulation of the voltage supplied to the discharge\nlamp by the ballast without sensing the lamp voltage itself.', 'A safety control circuit (20) is used in a series resonant ballast\n(100) to control the operation of the ballast when a lamp (60) is removed\nfrom a lamp fixture ellectrically connected to the ballast.

When the safety control\ncircuit (20) senses a diode clamp current, it activates a transistor Q4,\nwhich consequently grounds one of the terminals of the dimming control\ncircuit (30). The dimming control circuit (30) is then forced to reduce\nthe duty cycle of one of the inverter transistors Q2, Q3 to a minimum.\nThis causes the output voltage available across the removed lamp to drop\nby almost 20 % which in turn reduces the through lamp leakage current\nto safe levels. Once the lamp (60) is replaced in the lamp fixture, the\nsafety control circuit (20) no longer controls the dimming control circuit\n(30) and therefore the ballast (100) returns to normal operation.']"

The first bit-error-rate quality factor selection\ncorresponds to the conventional ATSC FEC encoding systems, and the second bit-error-rate\nquality factor selection provides an ATSC-like FEC encoding scheme that substantially\nimproves the bit-error-rate. The first quality factor selection effects a 2/3\ntrellis encoding, whereas the higher quality factor selection effects a 1/3\ntrellis encoding. Because the high-quality trellis encoding rate of 1/3 is half\nthe lower-quality trellis encoding rate of 2/3, the data rate of this high-quality\nencoded bit-stream is half that of the conventional lower-quality encoded bit-stream.\nThe 1/3 trellis encoding is effected using an ATSC-compatible encoding and a\nmodified symbol mapping. The encoding scheme provides 2:1 data redundancy and\nthe symbol mapping provides a maximum distance for the redundant encoding. By\ncombining techniques that each decrease the likelihood of an uncorrectable\nerror at the receiver, the substantial improvement in bit-error-rate can be\nachieved. At the receiver, a single trellis decoder with different metric tables\nis used to decode the two bit-streams, thereby providing substantial compatibility\nwith ATSC-compatible receivers.', 'In the coding device and method, m-bit information words are converted into n-bit\ncode words such that the coding rate m/n is greater than 2/3.

In one embodiment, n-bit code words\nof the first type end in zero, n-bit code words of the second type end in one, n-bit\ncode words of the first kind start with zero, and n-bit code words of the second\nkind start with zero or one.

In\nthe decoding method and apparatus, n-bit code words are decoded into m-bit information\nwords. The decoding involves determining the state of a next n-bit code word,\nand based on the state determination, the current n-bit code word is converted\ninto an m-bit information word. The decoding device and method are employed to\nreproduce information from a recording medium, and to receive information transmitted\nover a medium.', 'Received signals are decoded based on a coupling between bits of the received signals introduced by the channel over which the signal is transmitted or by the transmitter which transmitted the signals. For example, in a higher-order modulation scheme, such as 8-PSK, individual bits grouped in a given symbol are generally coupled rather than fully independent. Accordingly, decoding information on a first one of the bits processed through a forward error correction decoder may be used to adjust the soft information from a demodulator for one or more of the other bits contained in the same symbol for use in processing those bits through the forward error correction decoder. Particularly where interleaving is utilized, a first bit may be processed through the decoder before the soft information on another of the bits is needed, thereby allowing an intermediate decision soft value for the first bit to be used in generating the input value to the decoder for the subsequent bit. Alternatively, a multi-pass process may be utilized which may allow all of the bits to be decoded utilizing soft information from the first decoding pass to affect the input to the decoder during the second pass for coupled bits such as those transmitted in a common symbol.']"
